My original intent was to use the Last.fm api to explore the data I had been tracking for many years of my song listening habits. Unfortunatly I found part of the way through the writing process that the API that they have does not track the date that songs are played, so I could not create the type of visualization I initially intended on making. Instead I spun my idea to focus on music exploration and investigating the relationship between how often a song is played and how recently it has been added. The end result came out rather visually interesting. Using svg gradients I minipulated the color of each individual bar of the graph based on a time vs playcount algorithm that I wrote. Tracks that are listen to often appear as a hot pink color, while "cooler", older tracks appear in a blue color, and a wide range of tracks in between can be seen. I hoped to add additional functionality through sorting, and alternate data sets, but I ran out of time after struggling with D3 for a few weeks. In the end I'm satisfied with what I created, but hope in the future I can extend it further.

All data and images were self-created.
